Fake Currency Detection with Machine Learning

The dataset I will use in this task for fake currency detection can be downloaded from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/data_banknote_authentication.txt. The dataset contains these four input characteristics:

>The variance of the image transformed into wavelets
>The asymmetry of the image transformed into wavelets
>Kurtosis of the image transformed into wavelets
>Image entropy
The target value is simply 0 for real banknotes and 1 for fake banknotes. Now letâ€™s get started with this task of Fake Currency Detection with Machine Learning
